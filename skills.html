Technical Skills:
   I have learned and practiced coding languages like C, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
   I have a keen interest in Machine Learning.
   Hence, I have enrolled myself in an ML course.
   I am an optimistic student.

   
Non-Technical Skills:
   Since my childhood, I have performed at various singing and dancing events.
   I have learnt professional sketching and drawing skills at a very young age.
   In this Corona pandemic, I've brushed up on a very old hobby
   of mine which is playing piano.
   I am also learning to speak and write French language.
