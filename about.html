    Hello There ! 

    I am just another girl next door who was brought up in Mumbai.
    I went to Mother Teresa English Sec. School and my +2 was done at
    Shri T. P. Bhatia Junior college of science, both at Mumbai.
    
    Currently I am pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering 
    at Visveswaraya National Institute of Technology.
